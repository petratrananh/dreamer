        <h1>3 steps how to understand your dreams</h1>
        <p>Michael Lennox in his book speaks about 3 steps to understand your dream.</p>
        <p>It is still hard to explain ,what are the dreams and why we`re dreaming. Even dr. Martin Lennox, the practicing psychologist and one of the most respected interpreters of dreams also doesn`t know the clear answer. De facto, we are still searching for one. The truth is , we have no idea what are the dreams and why we`re dreaming .</p>
        <h2>Universal picture</h2>

        <p> First of all it`s universal picture/image. Probably you`re asking right now what does it mean. It means that we consider the things as universal when we know it or most of us understand the picture. The More you recognize specific thing or circumstance the more it`s universal.<br>
            For example Love is universal. All of us know what is it and all of us can identify with it.<br>
            Our unconsiousness is manifested by symbols. When we are dreaming , all of the images are based on our imagination. Every image is connected to general association. Although our feeling and attitude is different to the image .<br>
            The example is: If few people are looking in the same direction from same distance at the valley, the picture is almost same. They all would agree that the thing on the left is a tree. Of course someone could say it`s an apple tree the other could say it`s a birch etc. Despite all of the details it is still a tree.</p>




        <h2>
            The view through lens
        </h2>
        <p>The second step is called view throug lens. Let`s go back to previous example with valley. That was the universal picture/image.
            Now imagine that you are really looking through lens of the camera. The tree is visible but the lens block the view at the valley. Everyone who`s standing with you is on different place and will have different perspective on the tree as well.
        </p>
        <img src="image/lens.jpg" alt="camera lens" class="lens">
        <h3>The personal focus</h3>
        <p>After these 2 steps there;s the last one . The Personal focus we reach by adjusting the view throuh lens . This step includes our personal attitude, the personal values and our relationship to the thing. </p>
        <p class="example">Example:</p>
        <p> Let`s say you have a great respect to the police. Some members of your family also work for the police. One day you have a dream that policeman stops you while you`re driving the car. You get a fine for speeding.<br>
            <p class="example">Universal picture </p>
            <p>= generally in our society police represents the guardian of law and order. At the same time it represents observance of order and in the vent of breaking the rules there are possible consequences.<br> </p>
            <p class="example">The view though lens</p>
            <p> = The guardian of law and order stopped interrupted my journey to somewhere, to inform me that I made a mistake.
                = The policeman in your dream can represent some part of your personality, which you instictively trust, but more about that here. </p>
            <p>So if we focus the universal picture through lens , we can get to the possible meaning of the dream. In some areas of life , you`re moving too fast and your unconsciousness is trying to tell warn you: If you won`t be more careful ,it can have serious consequences.</p>
