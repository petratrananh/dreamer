        <h1>What are the dreams?</h1>
        <img src="image/article.png" style="float:left; margin-right:10px;" height="350px;">
        <p>It is still hard to explain ,what are the dreams and why we`re dreaming. Even dr. Martin Lennox, the practicing psychologist and one of the most respected interpreters of dreams also doesn`t know the clear answer. De facto, we are still searching for one. The truth is , we have no idea what are the dreams and why we`re dreaming .</p>
        <h2>The dreams according to scienceâ€¦</h2>
        <img src="image/i.jpg" style="float:right; margin-left:10px;" height="355px;">
        <p>The neurologists are making improvements in searching for relationships between dreams and human memory and learning. Improvements in looking for relationships between dreams and the mood of human and the state of their mind.<br>
            The Scientist are more focused on technical features.</p>
        <p>The problem with scientific approach is ,they do not consider psychological, emotional or spiritual reasons, why we are dreaming.
        </p>
        <p>In other words according to them the dreams are regular neurological functions and they don`t have deeper meanings. Doctor Lennox in his book Dream Sight expressed his disagreement with this attitude and I have to say, I feel the same.</p>


        <h2>The importance of dreams</h2>
        <p>So if you do want to understand your dreams, it`s important to be aware of that, they present the fragments of important information. This information you can not recognize while we`re awake.<br>
            Metaphorically said, the dreams are like raw rocks , collected from depth of our souls. If we interpret them well , polish them and grind them, we gain precious stones. They will help us to explore and get to know ourselves better.<br>
            I can`t offer you the 100% right answer that the interpretation of dreams are precise. But you can get closer to at least a potential correct answer. Minimum to bring you informative value.<br>
            It`s only up to you , how you decide to work with that information and it`s only up to you if you believe it or not.
